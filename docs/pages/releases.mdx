# Releases

## Contract-Based Alpha (v0.1.0)

*December 3, 2024*

Keyspace v0.1.0 is the first smart contract-based implementation of Keyspace. The dedicated keystore rollup has been removed. Keyspace keystores are now stored in the smart wallet contracts themselves. This release supports OP Stack L2s only.

## Dedicated Rollup Beta (v0.0.2)

*June 18, 2024*

The Dedicated Rollup Beta (v0.0.2) release of Keyspace introduces [`keyspace-client`](https://github.com/base-org/keyspace-client/tree/v0.0.2), an example TypeScript client for Keyspace with an integrated smart wallet, and [`keyspace-recovery-service`](https://github.com/base-org/keyspace-recovery-service/tree/v0.0.2), an RPC service for generating SNARK proofs of the signatures users sign to change their keys. The supported chains have been expanded from Base Sepolia and Optimism Sepolia to include Arbitrum Sepolia, Gnosis Chiado, Polygon Amoy, BSC Testnet, and Avalanche Fuji.

## Dedicated Rollup Alpha (v0.0.1)

*March 29, 2024*

Initial preview release of Keyspace, including a running Keyspace sequencer and an example Go client for Keyspace's RPC calls.
