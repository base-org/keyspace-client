# Revoking Signers

## Preconfirming Revocations

Preconfirmation is a security feature that allows you to prepare for signer revocation:

1. **Pre-approval**: Set up revocation parameters before they're needed
2. **Immediate Execution**: Quick revocation when necessary
3. **Cross-chain Coordination**: Ensure revocation propagates correctly

## Compromised Signers

When a signer is compromised, quick action is needed across all chains:

### Missed Chains

If some chains weren't updated when a signer was compromised:
- Use emergency revocation procedures
- Sync revocation to missed chains immediately
- Monitor for unauthorized transactions

### New Chains

For chains that become available after a signer was compromised:
- Block compromised signers from activation
- Implement additional verification steps
- Use updated configuration only

### Rollups of Missed or New Chains

Special considerations for rollups:
1. **Inherited Security**: Understand how L1 security affects L2
2. **Sync Timing**: Account for finality delays
3. **Verification**: Ensure proper proof validation
