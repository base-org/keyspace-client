# Using New Signers

## Set and Sync Together

When adding a new signer to your wallet, you can perform the configuration update and sync operations in a single transaction. This approach:
- Ensures immediate consistency across specified chains
- Reduces the number of transactions needed
- Provides better UX for end users

## Sync via Wallet Vendor

Wallet vendors can provide automated syncing services to improve user experience:

1. **Vendor Services**:
   - Monitor master chain for configuration changes
   - Automatically trigger syncs to replica chains
   - Handle gas fees for sync operations

2. **User Benefits**:
   - Simplified onboarding
   - Reduced complexity
   - Better cross-chain experience 

## Sync with the New Signer

After adding a new signer, you'll need to ensure it can be used across all chains:

1. **Initial Setup**: Configure the new signer on the master chain
2. **Sync Process**: 
   - Use Merkle proofs to sync to supported chains
   - Use deposit/withdrawal for other chains
3. **Verification**: Confirm the signer is active on all desired chains

### ERC-4337 Validation Restrictions

#### EIP-4788 Beacon Root Oracle

Using 4788 still puts us in a pretty good place: each slot gets written less than once per day, so it's not really dangerous for bundlers to whitelist them and our proofs will have a long shelf life. It should be relatively straightforward to get popular bundlers and Conduit-style single-chain providers to whitelist all of these slots, and push for access to these slots to just be standardized everywhere.
